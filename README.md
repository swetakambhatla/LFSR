design of Linear feedback shift register

In a LFSR, D flip flops are used to form the shift register blocks and the output of few D flip flops is given to an EX-OR gate. Whose output id fed back to the first flipflop. This is called the feedback mechanism. Linear feedback shift registers make extremely good pseudorandom pattern generators. When the outputs of the flip-flops are loaded with a seed value (anything except all 0s, which would cause the LFSR to produce all 0 patterns) and when the clock signal is applied to the LFSR, it will generate a pseudorandom pattern of 1s and 0s. The only signal necessary to generate the test patterns is the clock. A n-bit LFSR produces the maximum number of PRPG patterns possible and has a pattern count equal to 2n â€“ 1, where n is the number of register elements in the LFSR. The generation of patterns is done by transition. For example, for a 4-bit LFSR there will be 24-1=15 patterns generated and from 16th it will return to original state.
